    <p  class="text-center lead">So this is my first attempt at describing myself so it might be a bit wacky so hope you keep up.I am Priyanshu Gautam (currently studying at my home ) currently pursuing my dual degree course in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur.
    I was born in Lucknow Uttar Pradesh and did my early schooling from St Thomas Lucknow. One of the only memories that I have of that school is my mum telling me that I won a first prize in a handwriting competition (Although that's hard to belive due to my horrible handwriting right now). Fast forward to moddle school which was from KV Goa. These years I cherish because of the fact that you could do so much more apart from books and studies. This was when I was introduced formally to sports like chess and football which remain my favourite past-times till date.
    It was in 2015 when we actually came to Varanasi. The journey from here has been a roller coaster ride some of which you get to know about in the next section.
    Life until now (1% completion) has actually taught me various things some of which are worth mentioning. First: Take things as they come to you. Second do whatever you like to and don't waste your time on what you hate. Third have a balance between blaming yourself and taking responsibility. Fourth do not either belive or judge anybody upon anything without proof. Fifth Give your body ample rest and Enjoy your life. Second (Actually the pic explains sit all <i>Mike Drop</i>).<br><br><img src="Abooutimg.jpg"><br><br>
    This is all for this section hope you made it this far just want to tell you that you're amazing.
