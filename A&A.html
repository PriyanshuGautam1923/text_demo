          <h6 class="abc"><applause-button style="width: 58px; height: 58px;"/></h6>
          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">My Father</span>- My father has been and continues to be my greatest source of inspiration. Somebody I look upto from celebrating my smallest of achievements to lifting me up from my greatest of failures. He has always been behind me concrete as a rock which help me take my decisions much more freely.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">My Mother</span> - Describing her in words is just beyond my capabilities. She is just an epitome of dedication hardwork and truthfullness towards work. She is much more expressive and fun loving but always have managed to adjust her schedule according to my work and study hours.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">My Elder Brother</span> - He is that silent kid that I always looked upto for answers when everybody could'nt solve . I still remember his caring gestures after I was at rock bottom after Class X results constantly reminding me that I deserved more than this. He has always been the guide telling what is coming ahead I just got to know what studies would be like two years from now just by seeing him his guidance always helped me.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">Amit Sir</span> - What can I say about this superhuman. He is the only teacher that has been my support system 24Ã—7 listening to all my stupidest silly mistakes and reminding me that I will improve. Apart from a brilliant and one in a million physics teacher he is more as a companion. Whether it be conducting quizzes for NTSE or taking NSEJS classes till 6 in the evening or it be conducting tests for Mains. He has literally put everything on the line even his health.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">Akhilesh Sir</span> - He is also a gem of a teacher especially for biology. His explanations can be a bit harder to understand but speaking of relevant content delivery whether it be KVPY or NTSE Me getting my highest grades in Biology right from class 9th through KVPY or even in the college the major credit of this goes to him.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">Ashwani Sir</span>- Hard to find truthful teacher. Literally has an immense sense of humour with extraordinary knowledge One of the few teachers that made chemistry fun to learn. He also had that corner where he does'nt literally cares about what happens further. But his dedication in the lockdown period was a shear hats off.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">Jitendra Sir</span> - Sticking to the subjects and clearing doubts especially in class 9th - class 10th whether it be taking classes for RMO / INMO or bagging the bronze medal at Seamo Olympiad. The major credit of building a strong foundation in maths and making me believe that the more horrifying the Question looks the easier it is to solve all credit goes to him.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">Kediya Sir</span> - His effortless ways of solving problems and making maths dynamic was special. His content delivery alongwith the standards is just top notch .The plethora of books along with the strict boundary for JEE makes him the best in the business Whether it be confirming that the Q is itself wrong or there is a much shorter way of doing it he was always spot on.<br></p>

          <p class="lead"><span class="mentors">Siddharth Sir</span> - His love and passion for the subject was just class above. Apart from many of his qualities the ones that standout for me is his desire to help. He had the passion and desire to solve my doubts without even knowing me the least even without have seen me.<br></p>

          <p class="lead">The list of teachers was always supposed to be long but I just can't help it. There are much more worth mentioning whether it be <span class="mentors">Basant Sir</span> with his own unique style of teaching Chemistry or be it <span class="mentors">Anoop Sir</span> who just silently played such a big role in the selectons in NTSE or be it <span class="mentors">Himanshu Sir</span> with his sweet and humble nature <span class="mentors">Anand Sir</span> who always geared upto the task of solving any Q the way we wanted. How can I even miss <span class="mentors">Shailesh Sir</span> such a saintly personality with all his efforts to tirelessly teach all the intricacies of the subject however complex they might be.<br></p>

          <p class="lead">And last but not the least the school teachers right from <span class="mentors">Sarwat ma'am</span> <span class="mentors">Sajida ma'am </span><span class="mentors">Vindhya Sir</span> Or <span class="mentors">Nilopher Ma'am</span> <span class="mentors">Ruhi Ma'am</span> or <span class="mentors">Shivam Sir</span> the mentor of my first web devlopement classes.It has just been their presence that have made this journey a treat</p><br>

          <p class="lead">I just Thank You all for moulding me into what I am today and I will always be in debt of you all<br>

          Thankyou.</p>
